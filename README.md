# HacktheBaySwampMonsters
Using Land Cover Type of Upstream Area to Predict Pollution in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed

## Data & Modeling

The modeling code lives in the `ModelCode` directory, and the data transformation scripts live in the `eda` directory.

## Demo

The `react` and `flask` demo lives in the `demo` directory.
It requires running both the flask server (`cd demo/server ; python app.py`) and the React front-end (`cd demo/client ; npm start`) once you have the requirements installed.
